# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting  

A data analysis project focused on understanding **Walmart’s weekly sales performance** and building a **simple forecast** using moving averages.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
The goal of this notebook is to:  
- Explore and analyze sales patterns over time.  
- Identify performance trends by store size.  
- Build a basic time-series model (Rolling Mean) to estimate future sales.  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and formatted raw data.  
- Converted date columns for time-based analysis.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Investigated overall weekly sales distribution.  
- Compared sales by store size group.  
- Detected seasonal and temporal trends.  

### 3. Visualization  
- Created interactive **line and area charts** using Plotly.  
- Visualized sales trends and store size comparisons.  

### 4. Forecasting  
- Applied a **20-week Moving Average** to smooth and predict future trends.  
- Illustrated simple forecasting results visually.
